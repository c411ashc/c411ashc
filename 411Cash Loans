As proposed, the CFPB’s approach would lead to major changes in the market for payday and similar loans, notably by accelerating the general shift toward installment loans that consumers pay off over a period of months instead of weeks. However, the prospect of harmful loans would persist because the proposed rule would leave lenders free to charge any rate and set almost any term as long as they make a “reasonable determination” that the borrower can repay the loan. Under this vague directive, payday lenders are in the driver’s seat, because the rule would allow them direct access to borrowers’ checking accounts or, in the case of auto title lenders, grant them the power to repossess vehicles.

As drafted, the CFPB rule would allow lenders to continue to make high-cost loans, such as a line of credit with a 15 percent transaction fee and 299 percent interest rate, or a $1,250 loan on which the borrower would repay a total of $3,700 in fees, interest, and principal. These and many other high-cost payday installment loans are already on the market in most states, and they will thrive if the regulation takes effect without changes.
