411 Cash Loans

To get a payday loan, borrowers must have checking accounts and income, so they already are bank customers. But financial institutions have lacked clear guidelines from regulators that would allow them to serve these customers’ credit needs at a fair price. Before the CFPB announced the draft rule, at least three large banks were already preparing to use the 5 percent payment option to make small loans at prices far lower than those charged by payday lenders. By placing clear product safety standards such as the 5 percent payment option in limbo, the bureau has jeopardized the only part of its original framework that could save millions of borrowers billions of dollars. For example:
Under the 5 percent payment option, a $400 three-month bank loan would cost $50 to $60 in total fees.
But under the CFPB’s draft rule, payday lenders will remain in control of this market and charge fees of $360 or more for the same $400 in credit.
